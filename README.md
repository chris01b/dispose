# DispoSe
Gain followers by exploiting follow-back culture.

## Methodology
Dispo Beta doesn't show how many people you follow => No ratio shame

Dispo Beta doesn't have a feed of the people you follow => No need to prune your feed for content you enjoy

Dispo Beta doesn't have rate limits on their api => Use machine speed instead of scrolling

**=> Follow everyone on the app so you gain the most followers**

## Installation
